# Pandas-Vs-IMDB
Exploring an IMDB dataset with Pandas, SciKit-Learn and Bokeh.


The following project is broken into three iPython Notebooks.

- Pandas Vs. IMDB explores using Pandas and Bokeh to gain knowledge of what types of movies seem to be most popular.  By charting this data against the movie's budget we can see how different genres have different popularity "hot spots" where maybe the budget is not incredibly high but it still entertains a large number of people.

- SciKit-Learn Vs. IMDB uses a handful of machine learning algorithms provided by SciKit-Learn to see if we can predict aspects of a film based on a limited number of features.

- Curse of the Trilogy takes a look at the popularity of movie sequels and trilogies.
